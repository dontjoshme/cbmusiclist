Close Brace 5 Minute React: Mongoose

  Data Modeling for MongoDB

    Data models help track what data to send, and what data you're going to recieve, when making API calls

  Mongoose is a ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool

    Built to take the BSON transmitted by MongoDB and covert it to usable JavaScript objects/arrays/etc & vice versa


  ---------------
  Install & Setup
  ---------------

    From the project folder: $ yarn add mongoose

    In app.js at the bottom of the require block add: const mongoose = require('mongoose');

    Connect Mongoose to local MongoDB server and the collection:

      Add below the 'const app = express();' line: 

        // Connect Mongoose
        mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/cbmusiclist')

    Create dir at top level of project called "models"


  -------------
  Create Model
  -------------

    Create modelName.js in models folder of project

    Example contents of modelName.js:

      const mongoose = require('mongoose');
      const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

      const User = new Schema({
        username: String,
        password: String,
        firstName: String,
        lastName: String
      });

      module.exports = mongoose.model('User', User);
