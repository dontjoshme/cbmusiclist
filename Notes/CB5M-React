      React and React-Dom are necessary components for React Development

      Babel-Loader and Babel-Core let us use Babel while compiling with Webpack

      Babel-Jest gives us hooks for jest testing

      Babel-Preset-React gives hooks for JSX transpiling

      Sass-Loader and Node-Sass allow us to use Webpack to bundle .scss files into a single .css file

Notes
-----

  Babel: Transpiler - Takes in code from one language and spits out another.  Babel can take in ES6 and JSX and write out 

                      ES5, allow app to run on a wider array of browsers.


  Webpack:  Bundler - takes all the separate .js files and compiles into a single build.js. Does the same with .scss to 

                      .css and also filters out unused functions and other optimizations.
